# Registration-form
This code builds a registration form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can enter details like name, email, password, confirm password, and date of birth, and must accept terms. On submission, data is saved to localStorage and shown in a dynamic table. The form resets after each entry, demonstrating DOM manipulation and simple data storage.
